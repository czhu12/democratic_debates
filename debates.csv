And remember, of course by the popular vote, Hillary Clinton had almost 3 million more of those than Donald Trump, but we don’t elect the president by national popular vote, we do it by the electoral college, and there Donald Trump had the right combination of votes in the right state enough to win 306 electoral votes for him.",0 days 00:59:57.000000000,0 days 00:00:26.000000000,0 days 00:59:57.000000000,first_1
01:00:23,Speaker 26,"How does that map looking for 2020? Well, first of all, I think one thing you need to do, just understand how narrow that Trump path was in the electoral college in 2016, you can start by looking at Wisconsin. Look at that margin there, fewer than 25,000 votes separated Clinton from Trump in Wisconsin. This was a state that had not gone for a Republican in a presidential election since 1984. By a margin of fewer than 25,000 votes, Trump becomes the first in over three decades he gets Wisconsin.",0 days 01:00:23.000000000,0 days 00:00:31.000000000,0 days 01:00:23.000000000,first_1

And then there was Pennsylvania here about 44,000 votes. That’s the margin for Trump over Clinton in Pennsylvania. Trump wins all three of those states. Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, by a combined total of about 75,000 votes. That’s it. But that’s enough to win the electoral college. For Democrats, if they want to reverse the result of 2016 that is the easiest and most direct path, at least on paper. You flip those states where Trump’s margin was the narrowest, those states that had been voting democratic before 2016, you flip them back, you win the electoral college if everything else stays the same.

We always talk about Florida, right, remember? Florida, Florida, Florida from back in 2000. Well, here’s one. Again, Donald Trump somewhat of a surprise on election night, I think the Clinton campaign had been feeling decent about Florida, but Trump pulled out Florida in 2016, 29 electoral votes right there, we obviously expect to be very competitive in 2020.

And of course, Arizona is one Democrats had been talking about now. A long time red state that Democrats think demographically might be trending in their favor.

Well, what you see here, this is his average approval rating, meaning you’ve always got these different polls out there. One day, NBC will have one. The next day, CNN will have one. They’re always coming in from all over the place. This trend line is an average, a day-to-day average of all of those polls, put together. What you see here in this trend line is it’s a very narrow range that Trump is operating in. What I mean by that is look at this. This is his high watermark, his peak, as President. His average approval rating at its best, 46%. When was this? Early February 2017. That was his honeymoon. He had just become President. That makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60, 65, 70%, at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons. Trump’s honeymoon, he couldn’t even crack 50%.

But when the time came to say “yes” or “no” on one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of the last century, you voted for the Iraq war. You have since said you regret that vote. But why should voters trust your judgment when it comes to making a decision about taking the country to war the next time?",0 days 00:44:07.000000000,0 days 00:00:24.000000000,0 days 01:36:04.000000000,first_2
44:31,Joe Biden,"Because once the Bush abused that power. What happened was we got elected after that. I made sure the President turned to me and said, “Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.” I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq and my son was one of them. I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan. It’s long overdue. It should end. And thirdly, I believe that you’re not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with with what is the real stateless threat out there. We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism. So, I’d eliminate the act that allowed us to go into war and not the AUMF, and make sure that it could only be used for what it’s intent was, and that is to go after terrorists.

That is what reparations is. We need some deep truth-telling when it comes. We don’t need another commission to look at evidence. I appreciate what Congressman O’Rourke has said. It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal. All that a country is as a collection of people. People heal when there is some deep truth-telling. We need to recognize that, when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with. That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism.",0 days 00:34:38.000000000,0 days 00:00:48.000000000,0 days 01:28:17.000000000,second_1

If you did the math today, it would be trillions of dollars. And I believe that anything less than a hundred billion dollars is an insult.

The timing lights will remind you of these limits. Please respect them and please refrain from interrupting other candidates during their allotted time.

Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you don’t believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit. How do we pay for it? Raise your hand in the crowd if you’ve seen stores closing where you live. It is not just you, Amazon is closing 30% of America’s stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it. We need to do the opposite of much of what we’re doing right now. And the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. So let me share the math. On $1,000 a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone.

Donald Trump from Charleston to Baltimore to even the border is using the tired old language of demagogues, of fear-mongers, of racists to try to divide our country against itself. We know who Donald Trump is but in this election the question is who are we as a people? We have serious problems in America. We have deep wounds and seriously, deeply rooted challenges. We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward. Because we know in this country that our fates are united, that we have a common destiny.

Senator Harris, this week you released a new healthcare plan which would preserve private insurance and take 10 years to phase in. Vice President Biden’s campaign calls your plan, “a have-it-every-which-way approach” and says it’s just part of a confusing pattern of equivocating about your healthcare stance.

14:45,Kamala Harris,"Well, they’re probably confused because they’ve not read it, but the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families. Listening to experts, listening to healthcare providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people. Responsive to their needs, understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long. That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.",0 days 00:14:45.000000000,0 days 00:00:37.000000000,0 days 00:14:45.000000000,second_2

I listened to American families who said, I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So I designed a plan where yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare. Because the bottom line is this, we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.

Babies will be born into our plan and right now four million babies almost are born every day in America or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare. Your plan by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans.

He’s got a new name for it. It’s just as dangerous as the old NAFTA. It’s going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA, like it did to Michigan. And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA. So Vice President, I believe you’re the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA.

We have made the income inequality worse, not better, through the policies of the federal government. We’ve spent 5.6 trillion dollars in the Middle East. That’s 12 or 13 trillion dollars that, from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan or anywhere else in America, we might as well just have lit that money on fire. We’ve got to stop doing that. And we need to invest in America again. For the money that we’ve spent, that I just described, we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country.

In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitative and abusive jobs and relationships around the country. I’m talking about the waitress who’s getting harassed by her boss at the diner, who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is. What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses. And the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands.

But what he wrote an Op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, “Create the deterioration of family.” He also said that women who were working outside the home were, “Avoiding responsibility.” And I just need to understand, as a woman who’s worked my entire career as the primary-wage earner, as the primary caregiver… In fact, my second son Henry is here and I had him when I was a member of Congress.

As a single father, who in fact raised three children for five years by myself, I have some idea what it costs. I support making sure that every single, solitary person needing child care get an $8,000 tax credit. Now, that would put 700,000 women back to work, increase the GDP by almost eight-tenths of 1%.

Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan. 14,000 service members are deployed there. This is not about arbitrary deadlines. This is about leadership. The leadership I will bring to do the right thing, to bring our troops home within the first year in office. Because they shouldn’t have been there this long. For too long we’ve had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our service members, on their families.

Right now our strength abroad reflects our strength at home. What’s happened, really? We’ve fallen apart at home so we elected Donald Trump and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies. What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problem right here at home. We’ve spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that had unclear benefits. We’ve been in a constant state of war for 18 years.

It’s going to start right now, and on the stage, you see them. They have all met the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee. At least 10 others have not met the threshold, so for the first time in this primary, a single debate in a single night, with all the top candidates facing off. It is a critical test for candidates, and their campaigns, at a critical time for our country. They’re going to lay out their vision for the country, their records, their differences with President Trump, and each other. We’re going to do our best to bring you a lively, informative, and civil debate.

The cost and the consequence of his presidency. Racism and violence that had long had been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas. Where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured, by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place.

You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises.

Families pay every time an insurance company says, “Sorry, you can’t see that specialist.” Every time an insurance company says, “Sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry. We are not covering that prescription.” Families are paying every time they don’t get a prescription filled because they can’t pay for it. They don’t have a lump checked out because they can’t afford the copay. What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets. What’s going to happen in their budgets.

Gun owners would not only have to pass a background check, they would have to obtain a federal license to buy a gun. This would require, as you know, congress to pass legislation.

And I’m happy that people like Beto O’Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing, but this is what I’m sorry about.

When we look at this issue, my trade policy under a Harris administration is always going to be about saying, “We need to export American products, not American jobs.” And to do that we have to have a meaningful trade policy.

And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare thee well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result, Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences.

This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous.

The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they’ll pay more in new taxes, 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax.

I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see. This has to do with bad trade deals that we’ve seen in the past, that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that.

56:35,Andrew Yang,"Senator Warren is 100% right that we’re in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history, and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they’d projected. If we can’t learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.",0 days 00:56:35.000000000,0 days 00:00:49.000000000,0 days 00:56:35.000000000,fourth

And we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else. I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president.

This president has made corruption, originally, his argument, that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight, not for the wealthy and well-connected, but to fight for everyone else.

And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent.

Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in American history, it’s not a question of political expediency, it’s not a question of political tactics, it’s a question of right and wrong.

The media networks didn’t do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place.

Senator Sanders, today, the House of Representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Now, I don’t agree with the, your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word “climate change,” to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage.

I think this agreement, while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it, is much better than the one originally proposed.

The unemployment rate is at historic lows, unemployment among African Americans is down, the markets are booming, wages, while not growing as much as many would like, they’re still doing about as well as they were in the Obama/Biden era.

27:14,Tim Alberta,"Thanks Judy. Candidates, good evening. We’re going to talk about climate now. Senator Klobuchar, many scientists say that even if the US reduced its carbon footprint to zero by the year 2050 the damage will have been done. The climate change will have made certain places in the US unlivable. So knowing this, would you support a new federal program to subsidize the relocation of American families and businesses away from places like Miami or Paradise, California, perhaps. Davenport, Iowa.

27:49,Amy Klobuchar,"Well, I very much hope we’re not going to have to relocate entire cities, but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents. And the problem right now is that this climate change is this existential crisis and you are seeing it here in California with the fires that you just had.

This president doesn’t keep his decisions for seven minutes. So what I think we need to do get back into the International Climate Change Agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules on day three, the gas mileage standards.

Vice president Biden, I’d like to ask you, three consecutive American presidents have enjoyed stints of explosive economic growth due to a boom in oil and natural gas production. As president, would you be willing to sacrifice some of that growth even knowing potentially that it could displace thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers in the interest of transitioning to that greener economy?",0 days 00:32:00.000000000,0 days 00:00:23.000000000,0 days 00:32:00.000000000,sixth

We’re the only country in the world’s ever taken great, great crises and turned them into an enormous opportunities. I’ve met with the union leaders. For example, we should, in fact, making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained, that it doesn’t leak energy. That in fact we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make homes turn to solar power where there’s all kinds of folks out here, right here in California. We’re now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when in fact the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

We have an opportunity to put 550,000 charging stations so that we own the electric vehicle market, creating millions of jobs for people and installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market.

The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us, is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You’re talking about the Paris Agreement, that’s fine. Ain’t enough. We have got to, and I’ve introduced legislation to do this, declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe, just maybe, instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world.

Many of our Western allies rely heavily on nuclear energy because it’s efficient, affordable, and virtually carbon free.

I want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science, what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best. And that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader.

So the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes, talking about what’s happening on the coast is I just did, but also talking about what’s happening in the Midwest, where I’m from. It’s not fly over country to me, I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. We’re seeing an increase. 50% increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills.

The question is, do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say, “We need to protect our people from climate change?” Part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground.

However, it is not just about numbers. It’s about what you get done. And that is my argument. If you look at the poll at the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory. It showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage.

Not everyone did, but most of the Democrats did. Then I was on the judiciary committee when President Obama was president and we worked very hard on that immigration reform. We actually passed that with Republican votes. Then I was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the DREAMers, that would have solved that problem.

And for the last 10 years, that’s exactly what I’ve been doing, taking on unchecked corporate power. That’s why I’m for term limits, because if we’re going to have bold change, then we need new people in charge and new ideas. I’m the only person on this stage who’s built a large, multi billion dollar international business. I know how to grow prosperity. I can take on Mr. Trump on the economy and beat him. I’m the only one on this stage who said climate is my number one priority. It’s a crisis we have to deal with, but it’s also our greatest opportunity to create millions of good paying union jobs across the country and clean up the air and water and the black and brown communities where it’s so essential. So if you want to break the corporate stranglehold, beat Mr. Trump on the economy and solve our climate crisis.

I spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans and other cities, serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under President Obama, and I saw firsthand what many of you already know, our country is falling apart. Our senior citizens are working until the day they die. Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs. We’re seeing record high levels of depression, suicides, overdoses. Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger. Our way of life is changing faster than ever. And the simple fact is this, our politicians in D C succeed whether we the people succeed or fail. Washington DC today is the richest city in our country. What do they produce? Bad decisions? We need to get the money out of DC and into your hands, the hands of the American people.

02:47,Amy Klobuchar,"We have had quite a debate tonight, but I want to debate Donald Trump. This primary comes down to some simple questions. Who has the best ideas, the best experience, mostly, who can beat Donald Trump and how will she do it? So Donald Trump built his fortune on over time, over $413 million that he got from his Dad. My Grandpa, he was an iron ore miner, a union member who worked 1500 feet underground, and he saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my Dad to a community college.

An obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding what you have for yourself. Our politics right now because of Donald Trump are toxic. We need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me.

04:11,Pete Buttigieg,"So the nominee is going to have to do two things, defeat Donald Trump, and unite the country as president. It’s a tall order. And in order to do it, we’re going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today. That means building up a politics that is defined, not by who we exclude, not by who we reject, but by how many people we can call to this side. I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial, multi generational coalition and I’m seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic party before, but belong here now, because they’re definitely not on board with what’s going on in the Trump white house.
