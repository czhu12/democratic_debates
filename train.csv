You have said on the campaign trail, “I made sure the president turned to me and said, ‘Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.'” There was a major drawdown of US troops, and then ISIS seized, by some estimates, 40% of the territory in Iraq.

The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how we’re going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they’ll pay more in new taxes, 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax.

Here’s a promise I made. I will go to the Rose Garden once every year to read the names of transgender women of people of color who have been killed in the past year. I will make sure that we read their names so that as a nation we are forced to address the particular vulnerability on homelessness. I will change the rules now that put people in prison based on their birth sex identification rather than their current identification. I will do everything I can to make sure that we are in America that leaves no one behind.",CIVIL_RIGHTS

"In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act, it is important that you understand that our Medicare for All plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective way to bring healthcare to all, Kathleen Sibelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go. In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising, I couldn’t agree more. Senator Biden, your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo, doing business as usual. And that’s going to be about jacking up copays, jacking up deductibles-",HEALTHCARE
"that actually sequesters carbon into the soil. And you can go ask Gabe Brown and Allen Williams who actually make money off of regenerative agriculture, so we can move away from all the subsidies that we’re giving to farmers. They haven’t made a profit in five years, and we could start getting good food into our schools and into our communities. That’s going to drive healthcare down. That’s another part of the healthcare conversation-",HEALTHCARE

"Well, only one person, my good friend Barbara Lee was right on that issue. She was the only person in the house to vote against the war in Afghanistan. She was right, I was wrong. So was everybody else in the house. But to answer your question, I don’t think you do what Trump does and make foreign policy decisions based on a tweet at 3:00 AM in the morning or dessert your long time allies like the Kurds. I think you work with the international community, you remove all troops over a period of time, a short period of time within one year.",FOREIGN_POLICY
"You know, we can do this without charging people raising 30, 40 trillion dollars. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all. It couldn’t pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn’t pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who thinks it makes sense. We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. 160 million people like their private insurance, and if they don’t like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal. In my plan, drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board. But here’s the deal. They get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies, they want no competition, and my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.",HEALTHCARE
"The margin in Michigan, even closer, barely 10,000 votes. Trump over Clinton again, as the first time since ’88 that Republican carried Michigan. And then there was Pennsylvania here about 44,000 votes. That’s the margin for Trump over Clinton in Pennsylvania. Trump wins all three of those states. Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, by a combined total of about 75,000 votes. That’s it. But that’s enough to win the electoral college. For Democrats, if they want to reverse the result of 2016 that is the easiest and most direct path, at least on paper. You flip those states where Trump’s margin was the narrowest, those states that had been voting democratic before 2016, you flip them back, you win the electoral college if everything else stays the same. That’s the most direct path for Democrats, at least on paper.",REPUBLICANS

"My view on this and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking middle class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for All who can afford it, that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, “Sorry, we’re not covering your expensive cancer treatments. We’re not covering your expensive treatments for M.S. We’re not covering what covering what you need.”",HEALTHCARE

"It’s also about building a sense of belonging in this country because I think that’s what friendship and that’s what service can create and I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we’re seeing a rise in the deaths from despair. I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people and I’m asking for your vote to be that president when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.",FOREIGN_POLICY
